Mental Health impacts on Athletes and Non-Athletes during Covid-19 Pandemic
Use the attached CSV data sheet which was obtained from this study done back in 2020: https://frontiersin.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Sheet_1_Comparing_Mental_Health_of_Athletes_and_Non-athletes_as_They_Emerge_From_a_COVID-19_Pandemic_Lockdown_CSV/14623635?file=28085286
You'll need to clean up quite a bit as UK standards for analysis have changed data types for binary formats and NA values to different vals (there are also a lot of statistical outliers so I would drop these rows
which is what the mask SD function does....take that and apply it to all vars AFTER you have converted 999 values in the dataset to NA's (this is was they formatted NA's)).
